You are a senior software architect. Your task is to design the architecture for a new Streamlit application based on a set of Jira tickets.

The overall goal of the application is: {app_goal}

Here are the Jira tickets:
--- TICKETS SUMMARY ---
{tickets_summary}

--- TICKET DETAILS ---
{ticket_details}

Based on these tickets, define a logical application architecture.

**ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:**
1. **Match Complexity to Requirements** - Simple apps need simple architectures
2. **Respect EPIC Constraints** - If EPIC says "no FSM" or "simple", follow it strictly
3. **Prefer Functions Over Classes** - Use pure functions unless objects are clearly needed
4. **Minimal Modules** - Start with 1-2 modules, add more only if truly necessary

**WHEN TO KEEP IT SIMPLE:**
- EPIC mentions: "simple", "basic", "no complex state", "no FSM"
- Calculator, converter, or single-purpose tool
- Few tickets (< 10) with straightforward requirements

**Example - Simple Calculator:**
```json
{{
  "modules": [
    {{"name": "calculator", "functions": ["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "square_root"]}}
  ]
}}
```

**WHEN COMPLEXITY IS JUSTIFIED:**
- EPIC explicitly requires state management, workflows, or multi-step processes
- Many tickets (> 15) with interconnected features
- Real-world need for classes (e.g., database models, API clients)

**Example - Complex App:**
```json
{{
  "modules": [
    {{"name": "models", "functions": ["User", "Session", "Database"]}},
    {{"name": "api", "functions": ["fetch_data", "post_data"]}},
    {{"name": "ui", "functions": ["render_dashboard", "handle_input"]}}
  ]
}}
```

Group related tickets into modules. Each module should have a clear purpose and contain a list of functions that will implement the required features.

Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the following structure. Do not include any other text or markdown.
{{
  "application_name": "A descriptive name for the application",
  "application_goal": "A one-sentence summary of the application's purpose.",
  "modules": [
    {{
      "name": "module_name_1",
      "purpose": "A brief description of what this module is responsible for.",
      "tickets": ["TICKET-KEY-1", "TICKET-KEY-2"],
      "functions": ["function_name_1", "function_name_2"]
    }}
  ]
}}
