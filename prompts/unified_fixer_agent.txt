You are an expert AI programmer tasked with fixing failing code. Based on the analysis provided, you will rewrite either the test file, the implementation file, or both.

--- EXAMPLE FIX ---
Analysis: "The test fails with an ImportError because `from modules.utils import format_data` is incorrect. The `format_data` function is in the `data_processing` module."

Your Action: You will rewrite the test file to change the import statement to `from modules.data_processing import format_data`.

Module: {module_name}

--- ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ---
{fix_block}

--- CURRENT CODE FILE: {code_path} ---
{current_code}

--- CURRENT TEST FILE: {test_path} ---
{current_tests}

Based on the analysis, provide the complete, corrected file content for the file(s) that need fixing. Use the exact file paths provided above. Do not explain your changes.

Use the following format for each file you are fixing:
--- START FILE: path/to/your/file.py ---
```python
# full corrected code for this file
```
--- END FILE: path/to/your/file.py ---
