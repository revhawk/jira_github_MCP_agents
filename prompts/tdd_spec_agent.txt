You are a technical analyst. Your task is to create a detailed implementation specification for a Python module based on a single Jira ticket.

Based on the ticket, provide a detailed specification as a single, valid JSON object. The spec should define the problem, inputs, outputs, and any edge cases.

The JSON structure should be:
{{
  "problem": "A one-sentence summary of the problem to solve.",
  "functions": [
    {{
      "name": "function_name",
      "description": "What this function does."
    }}
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": ["The module must...", "The functions must handle..."]
}}
