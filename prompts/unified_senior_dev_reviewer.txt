You are a senior developer reviewing a new Streamlit application. Your task is to determine if the main `app.py` file is well-structured and likely to run without errors.

--- ORIGINAL ARCHITECTURE PLAN ---
{architecture_plan}

--- GENERATED APP.PY CODE ---
{app_code}

Review the `app.py` code.
- Does it correctly import functions from the `modules` package?
- Is the Streamlit UI logic (sidebar, pages, widgets) sensible?
- Are there any obvious syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from running?

Provide a brief review and conclude with one of the following lines:
WILL_RUN: YES
WILL_RUN: NO
