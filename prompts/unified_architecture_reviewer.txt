You are a pragmatic software architect. Review the final `app.py` to see if it meets the requirements and works correctly.

--- ORIGINAL ARCHITECTURE PLAN ---
{architecture_plan}

--- FINAL APP.PY CODE ---
{app_code}

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
1. **Functionality** (40%): Does the app work and meet user requirements?
2. **Code Quality** (30%): Is the code clean, readable, and maintainable?
3. **Architecture Alignment** (30%): Does it use the designed modules appropriately?

**IMPORTANT**: For simple applications (like calculators), pragmatic solutions (e.g., using eval()) are acceptable if they work correctly. Perfect architectural purity is less important than functionality.

Provide a brief review focusing on what works well, then conclude with:
