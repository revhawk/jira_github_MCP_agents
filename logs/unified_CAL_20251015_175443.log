2025-10-15 17:55:10,298 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-10-15 17:55:10,308 - INFO - Requirements analysis:
To analyze the EPIC requirements and proposed architecture, let's follow the task steps:

### 1. Extract Constraints from EPIC

**Constraints:**
- Build a simple, user-friendly calculator web application using Streamlit.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
- Create a single-page application with a clean, intuitive interface.
- No complex state management or FSM needed.
- Handle edge cases like division by zero and invalid inputs.
- Use Python with the Streamlit framework.
- Architecture should include a single Streamlit application (`app.py`) and a separate module for arithmetic operations (`calculator.py`).
- Use pure functions for testability.

### 2. Check for BANNED Patterns

**Banned Patterns:**
- FSM (Finite State Machines)
- State machines
- Observers
- Factories
- Strategies

### 3. Verify Architecture Matches EPIC Simplicity Level

**Proposed Architecture Analysis:**
- The architecture includes a module named `state_management` with functions like `FSM_class_model`, which indicates the use of a state machine.
- The presence of `state_management` and `FSM_class_model` contradicts the EPIC's constraint of "No complex state management or FSM needed."
- The architecture also includes a `memory_operations` module, which is out of scope as per the EPIC requirements.

### Output

```json
{
  "CONSTRAINTS": [
    "Simple, user-friendly calculator",
    "Basic arithmetic operations",
    "No complex state management or FSM",
    "Single-page application",
    "Python with Streamlit",
    "Pure functions for testability"
  ],
  "BANNED_PATTERNS_FOUND": ["FSM", "state machine"],
  "SIMPLICITY_LEVEL": "too complex",
  "APPROVED": "NO"
}
```

The proposed architecture is too complex for the EPIC requirements due to the inclusion of state management and FSM, which are explicitly banned. The architecture should be simplified to align with the EPIC's constraints.

2025-10-15 17:55:29,429 - INFO - UI design:
UI_PATTERN: button_grid

LAYOUT: The layout will consist of a grid of buttons representing the basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and number inputs. The interface will mimic a traditional calculator with buttons for numbers 0-9, decimal point, and operations. There will be a display area at the top to show the current input and results. The layout will be simple and intuitive, allowing users to click buttons to perform calculations.

REASONING: The application is a simple calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. A button grid layout is optimal because it closely resembles the physical calculators that users are familiar with, providing an intuitive and straightforward user experience. This layout allows users to easily input numbers and select operations, making it ideal for the single-page, single-workflow nature of the application. The button grid layout also supports real-time calculation display and input validation, aligning with the technical requirements and success criteria outlined in the epic context.
