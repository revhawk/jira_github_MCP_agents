2025-10-15 17:49:33,034 - INFO - Requirements analysis:
**CONSTRAINTS:**
- Build a simple, user-friendly calculator web application using Streamlit.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
- Simple two-number input interface.
- Clear display of results.
- Input validation for edge cases.
- No complex state management or FSM needed.
- Single Streamlit application (app.py).
- Separate module for arithmetic operations (calculator.py).
- Pure functions for testability.

**BANNED_PATTERNS_FOUND:**
- None

**SIMPLICITY_LEVEL:**
- Too complex

**APPROVED:**
- NO

**Analysis:**
The proposed architecture includes modules and functions that exceed the simplicity required by the EPIC. Specifically, the inclusion of modules like `input_processing` and `memory_management` suggests a level of complexity not aligned with the EPIC's constraints. The EPIC explicitly states no complex state management or FSM is needed, yet the architecture implies state transitions and memory functions, which are out of scope. The architecture should focus on a single module for arithmetic operations and a straightforward UI without additional layers of abstraction or unnecessary features.

2025-10-15 17:50:06,520 - INFO - UI design:
UI_PATTERN: button_grid

LAYOUT: The layout will consist of a grid of buttons representing the basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) along with number inputs. The interface will mimic a traditional calculator, with buttons for each operation and a display area to show the results. The number inputs will be placed at the top, followed by a grid of buttons for operations, and a clear display area for results.

REASONING: The primary function of the application is to perform basic arithmetic operations, which aligns well with a button grid layout similar to a traditional calculator. This layout allows users to intuitively select operations and input numbers, providing a familiar and efficient user experience. The button grid pattern is optimal for applications where users need to perform quick, repetitive tasks with minimal navigation, which is the case for a calculator application. The simplicity of the button grid also supports the goal of creating a clean and intuitive interface, as outlined in the epic context.
