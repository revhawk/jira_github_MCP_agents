You are a senior Streamlit developer. Your task is to create the main `app.py` file for a multi-module Streamlit application. You will integrate several business logic modules into a cohesive user interface.

Use a sidebar for navigation between different pages or features. Each page should correspond to a logical feature set, likely represented by one of the modules.

--- APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE ---
{architecture_plan}

--- AVAILABLE MODULES AND FUNCTIONS ---
These are the functions available for import from the `modules` package:
{functions_text}

--- MODULE SPECIFICATIONS ---
{specs_text}

--- INSTRUCTIONS & CRITICAL RULES ---
1. **Strictly follow the UI pattern from the reference example provided.** If the example uses a button grid, you MUST use a button grid.
2. **Use `st.session_state`** to manage the calculator's display and internal state.
3. **Call `st.rerun()` immediately** after any button click that modifies `st.session_state`. This is essential for the UI to update correctly.
4. **Use `st.markdown()`** to show the calculator display (e.g., `st.markdown(f"### Display: `{{st.session_state.display}}`")`). Do NOT use a disabled `st.text_input`.
5. Use `use_container_width=True` on all buttons in the grid for a clean, responsive layout.
6. Import the necessary functions from the `modules` package.
7. Call the imported functions to handle the logic.

Write the complete, runnable `app.py` file.
